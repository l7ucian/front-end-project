 "World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global\nwar that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast\nmajority of the world's countries—including all of the great powers—eventually forming two opposing\nmilitary alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly\ninvolved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of 'total war', the major\n participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort,\n erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources."]
